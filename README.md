## Colorado Lakes and Rivers!
Have you ever wanted to go kayaking, tubing or just to a lake or river in general, in Colorado, and just had no idea where to go? Well you've come to the right place. The goal of this page is for Outdoors enthusiasts, of any skill level, to share their "Spot" and to see other lakes and rivers to go in Colorado. So without further ado, [Get `Yakkin](https://colorado-rivers-sei.herokuapp.com/ "Rivers Homepage").

## Getting Started!
View all the rivers/lakes in the database by clicking the 'All Lakes/Rivers' link in the navigation bar. If you'd like to add your own Lakes or Rivers, simply login via Google Authentication and navigate to the 'Add Lakes/Rivers' page via the nav bar. After you've logged in, you can leave a review about any lake or river in the database with how difficult you found the lake/river to be. If you dont see your lake or river in the databse, simply add it!!

## Next steps:
In the future, I would like to make my app a forum where users can create a profile and connect with other users. I would also like to implement an api to show exactly where locations are. Possibly a Goggle Maps API.
